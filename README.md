# NUMPY-

INTRODUCTION :
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a foundational library in the Python ecosystem for numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Key Features of NumPy:

N-dimensional Arrays: NumPy's core data structure is the ndarray, which stands for "N-dimensional array". It is a powerful, flexible container for large datasets in numerical form.

Vectorization: NumPy enables vectorized operations, which means you can apply operations to entire arrays at once, rather than using explicit loops. This results in more concise and efficient code.

CONCLUSION:

NumPy is a versatile and efficient library for numerical computations in Python. It provides essential tools for handling arrays, performing mathematical operations, and integrating with other scientific libraries. Its efficiency and functionality make it a cornerstone in the Python scientific computing ecosystem.
